## LEADERBOARDS

So far I was unable to get the leaderboards working properly like in my other games which are written in P5.js. The code is there, but there is a problem with switching App Views.

If you manage to do it somehow, do ping me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/eQuMJF6) and I'll update this game, or if you want to give it a try, ping me anyway and I can give you more details on the problem.
